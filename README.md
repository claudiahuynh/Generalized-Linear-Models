# GLM and LR
This project involves analyzing homicide data across 50 large U.S. cities, focusing on solving homicides and exploring factors such as victim age, sex, and race (dataset 1). This project also builds a regression model to examine variables affecting child birthweight, comparing multiple model structures and assessing prediction errors using cross-validation (dataset 2).
